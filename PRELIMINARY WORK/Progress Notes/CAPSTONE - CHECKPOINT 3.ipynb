    "As of Sunday, March 1 I've been able to finally establish a program which will route data directly into a dataframe after a Selenium webscrape.  This initially proved to be more difficult to decode than initially thought, and took some additional time to lock down.   Since then, experimenting with keeping Selenium up and running long enough to make a deep collection of observations.  Preliminary test was at approximately 2700, last test doubled that.  As of 2:30pm Monday I have started to assess what is forcing the time-out before a higher number of observations were reached.  One blog introduced the fact that a minimized window in Chrome may have received less attention than one that was open, and reduced the priority of the function.  Trying to get through this learning about Selenium fast enough to drive increased observations closer to what is intended, but may start with a sample of almost 6000 observations to make some preliminary moves.\n",

    "Unable to resolve unexplained drop off of data collection (Fluctuating from 6000 down to avergae of 2700 each run).  Changed strategy evening of 3/3 to resolve.  Instead of attempting to scrape all info from site at once, breaking up process into individual, modified searches by wine type at a modified pricepoint.  New process will result in developing approximately 16 to 24 files that can be easily categorized by wine type (red, white, sparkling, etc.) prior to concatenating into one master csv file for cleaning, deduplication and manipulation.  Most importantly, it extends ratings from 4.9 down to 3.0, providing more of a range on ratings that could previously be captured.\n",

I'm currently concerned about data acquisition (to get up closer to the 45,000 observations I had intended, and if the models I produce with a lower number of observations can scale effectively.  I also need to go down another depth of ratings (into threes and twos) for the recommender to work well.   There is also more that I want to do to add features to the data to aid in search, so I am hoping to resolve some of this by our meeting Wednesday. "
